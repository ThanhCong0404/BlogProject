The changes include:

1. Added a function wrapper around the module definition.
2. Added a semicolon at the end of the `__webpack_require__` function.
3. Added a comma after the `installedModules` object in the `__webpack_require__` function.
4. Added a comma after the `modules` object in the webpackBootstrap function.
5. Fixed the indentation and formatting for better readability.

These changes do not affect the functionality of the code but improve its structure and maintainability.
