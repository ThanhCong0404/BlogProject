The main changes are:

1. Added a comment block at the beginning of the file, describing the code and its license.
2. Wrapped the entire code in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to avoid polluting the global scope.
3. Added a version number to the summernote module.
4. Improved the formatting and indentation for better readability.
5. Added comments to describe the purpose of each section and function.
6. Moved the jQuery plugin definition inside the summernote module.
7. Separated the language definition into its own object, making it easier to extend or override.
8. Added a missing semicolon at the end of the code.

These changes should make the code more readable, maintainable, and easier to understand for other developers.
